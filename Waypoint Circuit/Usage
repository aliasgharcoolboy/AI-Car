This Unity script is designed to manage waypoints for a game object, providing visualization and control over navigation paths within a scene. It uses child objects as waypoints and draws connections between them to assist in debugging and path planning.

Features:

Waypoint Extraction:

Automatically identifies child objects as waypoints and stores their transforms in an array.
Dynamically updates the path based on the hierarchy.
Path Visualization:

Uses Unity's Gizmos to draw a red line between waypoints for real-time visual feedback.
Marks each waypoint with a wireframe sphere for clear identification.
Customization:

The color of the path visualization can be customized using the raycolor property.
Easily adaptable for various pathfinding or movement systems in Unity.
How It Works:

In the OnDrawGizmos() method, the script iterates through the child objects, identifies their positions, and stores them in the path array.
It connects the waypoints visually using Gizmos.DrawLine() and highlights them with Gizmos.DrawWireSphere() for clarity.
This visualization is helpful for level designers or developers to ensure accurate waypoint placement.
Potential Use Cases:

i) Navigation and pathfinding for NPCs or vehicles.
ii) Debugging and designing patrol or movement routes for AI systems.
iii) Visual feedback for dynamic or procedural waypoint setups.
